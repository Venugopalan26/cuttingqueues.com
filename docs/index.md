# ðŸ§  CuttingQueues

> *A brutalistâ€™s field manual to mastering Celery, Redis, and distributed queues â€” one failure at a time.*

Welcome to **CuttingQueues**, an open engineering journey by [Venugopalan Iyengar](https://github.com/Venugopalan26).

This project contains **100 experiments** in Celery and Redis that systematically build your understanding of:
- Queue fairness
- Fault tolerance
- Worker orchestration
- Tail latency control
- Metrics, telemetry, and reliability

Each task is a *self-contained experiment* â€” with source code, failure reports, metrics, and a distilled insight.

---

## ðŸ§© How to Use
- Start from **Task #1** â€” Prefork vs Solo.
- Run each experiment locally using `docker-compose up`.
- Observe metrics on Prometheus & Grafana.
- Read each taskâ€™s analysis under `/docs/100_tasks/`.

---

## âš¡ Stack
- Python 3.11+
- Celery 5.3+
- Redis 7.x (Standalone & Streams)
- Prometheus + Grafana + Sentry
- Docker Compose

---

## ðŸ’¬ Philosophy
> "Every queue hides a truth about your systemâ€™s pain."  
> *CuttingQueues* is not just a guide â€” itâ€™s a debugging philosophy.
